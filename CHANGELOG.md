## [22.0.0] - 2026-06-17

### Changed

- Aligned with Angular 22.
- README documentation standardized.


## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-16

Initial release. The shared design-token foundation for the ng-hub-ui family,
extracted from the documentation app so every library reads one source of truth.

### Added

- **Primitive (`ref`) tokens**: full colour ramps (`--hub-ref-color-*`), spacing, radii, border widths, typography and icon sizing.
- **Semantic (`sys`) tokens**: surfaces, text, borders, shadows, focus ring, z-index, opacity, state overlays, transitions, and the semantic colour families.
- **Semantic colour families** generated from a per-theme SCSS map by the `hub-semantic-colors` mixin — each of `primary` / `success` / `danger` / `warning` / `info` exposes a uniform set: base, `-subtle`, `-dark`, `-border-subtle`, `-emphasis`.
- **8 built-in themes**: `light` / `base`, `bootstrap` (+ Bootstrap bridge), `dark`, `sunset`, `forest`, `mono`, `terminal` — switched with `[data-theme='…']`.
- **Two consumption paths**: the compiled `hub-tokens.css` (drop-in for any app) and the `hub-tokens.scss` source (override tokens via standard CSS custom properties).
